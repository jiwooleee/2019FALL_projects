<<Project 1>>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   is on Hailstone Numbers, a sequence generated by Collatz conjecture. 
  The sequence converges to 1, regardless of what number we start with.
  Specifically, no matter what number we start with, the sequence ends with 4, 2, 1.
  No one has been successful at proving why.
  
  Hailstone Numbers are a sequence with the first term = N that has the following property:
  
 -  if N is even, the next term = N/2
 -  else if N is odd, the next term = 3N + 1

<<Project 2>>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  performs a basic simulation of the Toilet Paper Problem posed by Donald E. Knuth in 1984.
  (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2322567?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
  
  Given that there are two toilet papers in the restroom, it calculates how quickly we use them up.
  
  I'd love to talk to the author one day

<<Project 3>>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  performs simple kernel-based image processing filters such as:
  
    - sobel
    - gaussian
    - glass
    - rotate
    - noisecancel
    - wave
  
  I like that it uses a lot of matrix multiplication
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<<Project 4>>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  uses connected-component labeling to detect objects in an image.
  
  It 1) labels each object and
     2) randomly colors them
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<<Project 5>>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  models a social network followers/followings.
  
  Lets the user add/delete friends and print the results.
  
  It was the most boring one + I rushed through it because the finals were near
